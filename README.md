# Python Project - TBD
## Code Louisville Data Analysis Project

While I have not figured out my project parameters just yet, I have identified some goals that I have for my project:

* Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app

* Create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used

* Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data

* Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
