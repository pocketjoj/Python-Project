# An Analysis of Medicare 2017 Surgical Claim Data
## Code Louisville Data Analysis Project

Thank you for your interest in my data analysis project! In this project, I will be using a Jupyter Notebook to analyze data furnished by a CMS (Medicare) API.

CMS API Endpoint: https://data.cms.gov/resource/2zuc-y5mm.json
API Documentation: https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cms.gov/2zuc-y5mm

My minimum goals for this project are outlined below:

* Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app

* Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

*	Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data

* Create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used (possibly)
